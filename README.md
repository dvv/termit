Termit
==============

Library for serializing Erlang terms to signed encrypted binaries and reliably deserializing them back.

_N.B. maintenance moved to https://github.com/erlangpack/termit_

Usage
--------------

A typical use case is to provide means to keep secrets put in public domain, e.g. secure cookies.

```erlang
% generate a token
Term = {this, is, an, [erlang, <<"term">>]}.
Cookie = termit:encode_base64(Term, <<"cekpet">>).

% token is ok
{ok, Term} = termit:decode_base64(Cookie, <<"cekpet">>).

% check whether token is not forged
{error, forged} = termit:decode_base64(<<Cookie/binary, "1">>, <<"cekpet">>).
{error, forged} = termit:decode_base64(Cookie, <<"secret">>).
{error, forged} = termit:decode_base64(undefined, <<"cekpet">>).

% generate expiring token
Term = {this, is, another, [erlang, <<"term">>]}.
% time-to-live is 10 seconds =:= secret valid no more than 10 seconds
Cookie = termit:encode_base64(termit:expiring(Term, 10), <<"cekpet">>).

% secret is ok within 10 seconds interval
{ok, Decoded} = termit:decode_base64(Cookie, <<"cekpet">>).
{ok, Term} = termit:check_expired(Decoded).

% after 10 seconds elapsed
{ok, Decoded} = termit:decode_base64(Cookie, <<"cekpet">>).
{error, expired} = termit:check_expired(Decoded).

% shortcuts for expiring security tokens, e.g. OAuth2 bearer tokens
Token = termit:issue_token([{user, <<"dvv">>}, {scope, <<"admin.*">>}], <<"ThanksBob!">>, 24 * 60 * 60).
{ok, Data} = termit:verify_token(Token, <<"ThanksBob!">>).
{error, forged} = termit:verify_token(Token, <<"ThanksBob?">>).


% generate non expiring token
Term = {a, b, c, [d, "e", <<"foo">>]},
Secret = <<"TopSecRet">>,
Token = termit:issue_token(Term, Secret),
{ok, Term} = verify_token(Token, Secret).
```
